                We do not label you an addict or alcoholic, nor do we believe
                that you have a disease. We have found that damaging labels,
                such as addict and alcoholic, rob you of your true identity.
                Itâ€™s the treatment philosophy at Lotus that sets us apart from
                all other rehab centers in the world.
